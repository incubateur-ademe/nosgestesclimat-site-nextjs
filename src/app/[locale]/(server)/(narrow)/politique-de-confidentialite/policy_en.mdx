## 8. How are the rights recognized to Data Subjects exercised?

In accordance with the GDPR, Data Subjects can, at any time, exercise their rights of access, rectification, deletion of data concerning them as well as their rights of limitation and opposition to Processing and portability of their Personal Data by sending an email to contact@nosgestesclimat.fr

Furthermore, when Personal Data Processing implemented by ADEME is based on the consent of Data Subjects, the latter can withdraw it at any time. ADEME will then cease to process Data Subjects' Personal Data without the previous operations for which Data Subjects had consented being called into question.

In addition, Data Subjects may legally have the right to define post-mortem directives relating to the retention, erasure and communication of their Personal Data, and this with a trusted third party, certified and responsible for respecting their will, in accordance with the requirements of the applicable legal framework.

Furthermore, any minor at the time of collection of their Personal Data may obtain its erasure as soon as possible.

Data subjects may request to exercise their right to object to Personal Data Processing concerning them for reasons relating to their particular situation when the Processing is based on ADEME's legitimate interest. This right of opposition also applies to profiling.

In case of exercise of such a right of opposition, ADEME will cease processing except when there are legitimate and compelling reasons for Processing that prevail over the interests, rights and freedoms of Data Subjects or for the establishment, exercise or defense of a right in court.

Data Subjects may also object to any processing related to prospecting without it being necessary to invoke reasons relating to their particular situation.  
Under the right of access, ADEME may request Data Subjects to pay reasonable fees based on administrative costs for any additional copy of data to that which will be communicated.

These rights are exercised by postal mail to the following address:

## 9. Information security / transaction security

ADEME implements all useful technical and organizational measures, considering the nature, scope and context of the Personal Data you communicate to us and the risks presented by their Processing, to preserve the security of your Personal Data and, in particular, prevent any destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, intrusion or unauthorized access to this data, accidentally or unlawfully.

The security and confidentiality of Personal Data depend on everyone's good practices. This is why Data Subjects are invited not to communicate their passwords to third parties, to systematically disconnect from their profile and their social account (especially in case of linked accounts) and to close their browser window at the end of their work session, particularly if internet access is made from a computer shared with other people.

## 10. Personal Data concerning minors

ADEME does not collect or process Personal Data relating to children under 16 years of age without prior agreement from parents or holders of parental responsibility for the child.

If Personal Data concerning children is collected via ADEME's Site and/or via Services or Products, parents or holders of the exercise of parental authority have the possibility to object by contacting ADEME at the address indicated above.

Furthermore, as stated above, the minor child at the time of collection of their Personal Data may obtain its erasure as soon as possible.
