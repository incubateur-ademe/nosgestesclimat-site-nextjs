The simulation and calculations are performed directly in your web browser, so your answers to the questions remain on your device—we do not collect any of them.

However, we do track some information about your use of this calculator, such as pages viewed and time spent, for the sole purpose of improving the tool.

In particular, we log the URL of the final simulation page, which contains your total carbon footprint and its breakdown by major categories (transport, housing, etc.).

*Updated on 06/26/2025*

The French Environment and Energy Management Agency, a public industrial and commercial establishment whose headquarters are located at 20, avenue du Grésillé 49000 Angers (hereinafter "ADEME"), places great importance on the protection of personal data it collects and processes as the data controller, in the context of the activity of the Nos Gestes Climat website (hereinafter the "Site").

Thus, the collection and processing of personal data by ADEME, in the course of its activities and the use of its products or services, informational or communication websites, databases, web applications (which may require the creation of an account and allow user/application interaction), and mobile apps, are governed by this data protection policy (hereinafter the "Policy").

All personal data processing implemented within the accessible services complies with applicable data protection regulations, particularly the provisions of the French Data Protection Act of January 6, 1978, as amended, and the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU 2016/679) ("GDPR").
