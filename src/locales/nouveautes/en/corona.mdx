# Le Corona

What's new in March 2024

![](/images/releases/corona.jpg)

> Plastic to protect nature? Contradictory? And yet that's exactly what's happening in Venezuela, which is trying to protect its last glacier at all costs.
> 2 Hectares. That's what's left of the last glacier in the Andean country, after the disappearance of the other five in recent decades.

### In short, the technical team has been busy this month!

- 👔 A new course dedicated to organisations
- 📚 New documentation to help you integrate Nos Gestes Climat into your website
- 🤓 A test to assess your knowledge of orders of magnitude
- 💐 Little surprises here and there on the site
- 🐛 Fixing all kinds of bugs
- 💧 And a big project to come... 🥁

### 👔 A course dedicated to organisations

This new course was released last week after several weeks' work! The aim is to give any type of organisation (business, local authority, association, or informal group) the opportunity to create its own Our Climate Gestures group, with a dedicated URL, a dashboard for tracking statistics (number of participants, average footprint, etc.), and a graph for comparing the group.

In the last few days, we've also fixed a number of errors that were making it difficult to create an organisation: now that's fixed, everything works perfectly (or if it doesn't, <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">go here</a>).

### 📚 New documentation to help you integrate Nos Gestes Climat into your website

The more fools we are (calculating our carbon footprint) the more we can act! It's therefore very important for us to encourage you to share our tool; but also to integrate it into your website, newsletter, blog, or other social network.
To do this, we've made a few changes (in particular, we've fixed the 'data-share' parameter used to retrieve simulation information in certain specific cases) and made available new documentation for integrating Our Climate Gestures in an iframe on your site.

### 🤓 A test to assess your knowledge of orders of magnitude

As you may have guessed, at Nos Gestes Climat, our role is to make everyone aware of the essential levers for individual action to help limit the climate crisis (in addition to the essential transformations required of businesses and institutions). To test your understanding of the major orders of magnitude, we've added a question at the very end of the simulator for a random selection of you 😈
For now, spoiler: you're super talented!

### 💐 Little surprises here and there on the site

- A new button on the Actions page to link to the ADEME website.
- An improvement on the image loading mode to make it faster.
- We've noticed that many of you are coming to our site via documentation pages or other pages. So to welcome you, we've added a pop-up banner to explain once again that our speciality is the simulator!

- The <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/ambassadeurs">list of our Ambassadors</a> has been updated. Take a look, we're so proud of you!

### 🐛 Fixing all kinds of bugs

in our Rankings page, on Friends Groups_

- For a long time it was impossible or complicated to create a <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/classements">group of friends</a> when you had an Adblock or equivalent - this button has been fixed!
- Sharing was also dysfunctional for certain types of phone and is no longer the case.
- And the rankings of friends within groups were also buggy: sometimes in thousands of tons (yikes), sometimes inaccessible... that's fixed too!

and just about everywhere else_

- Before, if you loaded an old simulation via the link you received by email at the end of the test, a bug would set your carbon footprint total to zero Tonnes of CO2e, and break the rest of the test (bravo for the 0T but... we know that's not possible).
- Some of the questions (particularly the mosaic on garden tools) also caused the simulation result to go to 0T.
- We've also improved our image management with a new component that improves server load and loading time.
- The help for entering kilometres travelled by car is back in operation.

### 💧 And a big project coming up... 🥁

We can't tell you much more than that, but you should know that the model/calculation team spends a lot of time researching and calculating new metrics, with a view to providing you with even better information on all the <a href="https://www.notre-environnement.gouv.fr/themes/societe/article/limites-planetaires">planetary limits</a>.
