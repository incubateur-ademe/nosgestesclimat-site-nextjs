> The only glacier in the Ariège department, the Glacier d'Arcouzan (or Glacier du Mont Valier) is a small cirque glacier in the Pyrenees. It made news on October 2, 2023, when <a href="https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/occitanie/ariege/foix/decouverte-enigmatique-sur-un-glacier-des-pyrenees-un-sac-a-dos-vieux-de-40-ans-emerge-de-la-glace-2849477.html">a 40-year-old backpack was discovered in its midst</a>!

## 🧮 The calculation model gets even better!

### 🎭 ⚽️ Leisure activities

You can now enter your <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1999">cultural</a> and <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2060">sporting</a> hobbies during the test. The footprint associated with each choice is based on a macro-economic approach. The idea is to give an initial estimate of the footprint of the activity in question without going into detail (in this version of the test, we don't want to ask for the exact number of golf clubs and balls). Thus, in this approach, part of the national footprint associated with the activity sector is allocated according to the choice made. Find out more in <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/divers/loisirs">our documentation</a>!

### 🏊‍♀️ Add swimming pool

Perhaps you've already had the opportunity to indicate whether or not you own an in-ground swimming pool? Since <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1948">last July</a>, you can find the pool footprint in Nos Gestes Climat, a template from <a href="https://futur.eco/simulateur/piscine/empreinte">Futur.eco</a>. To find out more, visit our <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/logement/piscine">documentation</a>!

### 🚬 Tobacco added

A question we've been waiting for since the beginning of Nos Gestes Climat, or almost... It's now <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1995">integrated</a>, with obviously all the precautions on the real impact of cigarettes which is not only "climate". With an extra 100 kgCO₂e for a regular smoker, quitting smoking is a gesture that can count!

### 💸 Redesign of the "expenses" question

Asking you to answer about your annual expenditure in € was not a "free" question... Many of you answered "I don't know" to this question: we have therefore chosen to <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1997">revise this question</a> to offer you 3 choices of answers <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/divers/autres-produits">based on INSEE household expenditure data</a>.

### And other changes

- Updated <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1993">emission factor for the French electricity mix</a>.
- <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2049">Numerous typo corrections</a>.

**We are currently working on <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/issues/2076">a writing charter for our calculation model</a>, with the aim of facilitating development of the application, but also helping external integrators to get to grips with the data **

## 🙋‍♂ A new "Challenge your friends" feature

Accessible from <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupes">the group mode</a>, this new feature makes it easy to compare results with family and friends. The group can include up to 20 people! For groups of more than 20 people, of course, poll and conference modes are still available.

## ❓ New version of the FAQ

As the team has grown over the last few months, we've been able to take up subjects that have been in the bins for several months! Updating our FAQ was one of them, and since <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/1181">last July</a> we've been offering you a "brand new" page that should answer most of <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/questions-frequentes">your questions</a>! Can't find the answer you're looking for? Write to us using the form at the bottom of the page.

## 👥 More complete model profiles

First and foremost to help us develop the calculation model and ensure that the results visualization components are optimal for the majority of our users, we've improved <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1968">the completeness of our personas</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/1215">visualization page</a> for them. Test them <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/personas">here</a>!

## 👀 New version of the tutorial

The test tutorial is now <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/1227">being improved</a>. We're in an A/B test phase: some of you may already have seen this new tutorial go by! The idea is to validate this new version by observing the statistical improvements associated with this new tutorial. Once validated, this tutorial will be available to all!

## 💌 NL

Thank you all for subscribing to the NGC newsletter (over 50,000 subscribers!), which not only allows you to receive your simulation results by e-mail, but also to keep up to date with the latest news from the site and in particular the blog, with our latest article concerning the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog/environnement/maladaptation">concept of "maladptation</a>"

## 🫶 Thank you for your contributions

### 🇨🇦 Added Canada (Quebec)

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/davidson-canada-devops">Alexandre Thieve</a>, who made it possible to put a Quebec version of the test online via a <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2000">direct contribution</a> to our repository!

## 🪲 Miscellaneous tech topics and bugs

### ⚙️ Publicodes-tools

Nos Gestes Climat's approach is also to enable as many people as possible to get to grips with the calculation model! So we're working on a complete set of tools based on the forms generated via Publicodes, to help more potential reintegrators of the NGC model. A first brick is available with <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/publicodes-tools">Publicodes-tools</a>, <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2006">used by NGC for model compilation scripts</a>).

### ✨ Order in the units

Extensive work on the "units" of the calculation model was carried out this summer. The aim? To guarantee a reliable model by adding calculation verification via calculation homogeneity. All the results of this work are described in <a href="https://accelerateur-transition-ecologique-ademe.notion.site/De-l-ordre-dans-la-gestion-des-unit-s-9331ddfd965741bfb2628504afd5dfc1?pvs=4">this technical article</a>!

**But also ...:**

- The arrival of a <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">dedicated</a> and more clearly identified <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">contact page</a>.
- The addition of a<a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/budget">team budget page</a> for even greater transparency.
- A <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/demo-iframesimulation">new way of integrating Nos Gestes Climat in iframe</a>, with the option of displaying the test directly without the static content directly accessible. Use case? The canton of Geneva, which is currently creating its own site, but uses Nos Gestes Climat for the carbon footprint test!

💡 As a reminder, all Nos Gestes Climat public service developments are made transparently on the Github platform, both on the <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/">site side</a> and <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat">on the calculation model side</a>.

See you soon for more great news!
