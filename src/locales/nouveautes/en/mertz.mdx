💧 The **Mertz Glacier** stands out with its spectacular tongue of ice stretching out into the Southern Ocean. It even "lost a piece" in 2010, forming a titanic iceberg! These colossuses of ice are the silent sentinels of our planet... and they remind us that every action counts to preserve their beauty 💙
