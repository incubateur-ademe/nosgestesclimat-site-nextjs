> 🇮🇸 To be a candidate in the Icelandic presidential elections, you must be at least 35 years old and have no criminal record. So why not the Snæfellsjökull glacier? A group of Icelandic activists have been trying for several months to launch this new candidate on the presidential trail, to ensure greater visibility for ecological issues in the campaign.

### What we did in June : 

- 🎳 New features on the Organisations route
- 🧮 A more complete carbon model
- ❄️ A fresh look at the Group of Friends mode
- 🙌 Improvements all round
- 🔧 Bug fixes



### 🎳 New features on the Organisations route

##### For everyone: 
- Better hierarchisation of information: unnecessary links have been removed
- Performance improvements: campaigns tended to load very slowly (especially those with several thousand people), it's now faster, and the loading experience is better

##### For administrators: 
- *One organisation to rule them all 💍*: a single organisation can now host several Nos Gestes Climat campaigns. You can create a campaign for each department in your organisation, or a campaign each year to track progress... it's up to you!

- You can now easily change your administrator email address: go to the organisation's settings, enter the new email address and then all you have to do is authenticate yourself with a code received on the new email, and that's it!

#####The next steps for the organisation path (we can't wait!): 
- Enable you to generate a unique QR code for each campaign
- Multiple administrators for a single organisation
- Aggregate the results of the various campaigns in the administrator account


### A more complete carbon model

- You've been asking for it for months, and now it's here. The request that held the record for occurrences: more than 40 people have asked us for it over the course of the year. You can now declare your photovoltaic panels as part of your electricity production. Youhou!
=> Next step: add solar panels (solar hot water)
- The order of the questions lacked a bit of logic, particularly at the end of the questionnaire, so we've changed all that by ~~forcing~~ around the publi.codes logic a bit
- The mosaics now work a little more logically: if you choose a suggestion, you can change your answers without worrying
- Housing newsletter cycle launched!

### ❄️ A fresh look at the friends group mode

- The calculation of 'strong and weak points' in the comparison within the group of friends has been revised: your strong points are the sub-categories in which your carbon emissions have the greatest difference (in number of tonnes) from the group average. And vice versa!

- You can now delete a participant from a group of friends if you need to sort them (only available to the group creator)
- Mention of the administrator and "you" was not always clear or displayed correctly: now it's OK!

### 🙌 Improvements everywhere

- The blog has been enriched with new articles, but now also offers more information about the article's writer, and its theme... so you'll soon be able to filter and classify them
- A new 404 page, extremely cute isn't it? 

<img style="width:400px" alt="404" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0202939-fbde-48d7-bf56-8ab9e1ddd20f">

- And illustrations everywhere!

### 🔧 Bug fixes

- Problems accessing the organisations had arisen: this has been fixed
- A number of people were seeing their simulation results at 0T carbon (the dream... but not the reality!), it was a problem with the history calculation that had crept in..
- A bug in entering your electricity bill has been fixed
