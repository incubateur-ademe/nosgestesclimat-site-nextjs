#Thwaites, the glacier of the apocalypse

##What's new for summer 2024?

> Thwaites is an Antarctic glacier the size of Great Britain. It is held back by a huge block of ice, which threatens to break off within three years. If this were to happen, the glacier's slide would cause sea levels to rise by several metres, accelerating disasters at breakneck speed, earning it the name of the Glacier of the Apocalypse.

**So, during the summer, the NGC team has not been idle: **

- 💦 New year, new imprint
- 💄 The calculator has a new look
- 🧮 Additions to the carbon footprint model
- 🕷 Some stubborn bugs have been fixed
- 🤯 And lots of things that seem trivial but are great

### 💦 New year, new footprint!

It's been a long time since something so revolutionary happened on Nos Gestes Climat. We're talking about a real paradigm shift here: now, when you calculate your carbon footprint, you're also offered an estimate of your daily water footprint.

- To see your water footprint: <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/fin/?mtm_campaign=nouveautes&mtm_kwd=thwaites">go to the end-of-test page</a>, and choose the "My water footprint" tab

- To find out more about water, we've published a number of blog posts that can inform you on the subject

&lt;button href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog/?mtm_campaign=nouveautes&mtm_kwd=empreinte_eau" >Go to the blog&lt;/button&gt

- To understand how the calculation is done, go &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/Le-calcul-de-l-empreinte-eau-a5dce01ebe2d4113b67eb53d7fe3e0dc?pvs=21">to our documentation&lt;/a&gt

### 💄 The calculator changes its head

It's been on our minds for a very long time, so we finally did it: the calculator now takes up the whole screen! This has enabled us to :

- add a 'pause' function to stop a test in progress and resume later.
- avoid unnecessary menu information that can distract from the test.
- improve the accessibility of score trends.

### 🧮 Additions to the carbon footprint model

🏘️ The calculation of the carbon impact of housing has been revised

- new calculation method to take better account of the impact of construction
- addition of a question on renovation

&lt;img style="width:600px" alt="Thermal insulation options selection interface" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dcf333b-1d88-4a5b-997e-2c7fde2bf994"&gt

🍽️ And we've also improved the meal questions

- new way of calculating the impact of meals
- question reworded for greater clarity

&lt;img style="width:600px" alt="Food habits selection interface with footprint calculation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b090a7f-70fc-45ff-b19e-42350c765dcd"&gt

🧠 We've spiced up a lot of the questions, thanks to rephrasing here and there to clarify questions that seemed unclear to you

✊ We've added some essential actions

- go solar
- switch to a green electricity offer
- choose a green finance provider

These actions are listed in a 'non-quantified' section of our actions because they are not included in the calculation of our carbon footprint according to the methodology we have set up and chosen with ABC. However, they are choices that can have a major influence on our individual impact and are the first steps towards commitment.

### 🕷 Some stubborn bugs have been fixed

🐞 Switching between languages used to work quite badly, and in many cases we ended up with bilingual pages or pages that always switched back to French: now that's fixed!

🐛 Some of you no longer had access to old results: we've recalculated all your old simulation results, and everything's green!

🦟 When you loaded an old organisation or group page, some of you were left with a blank page: now that's fixed!

🪲 The organisation parameters weren't saving properly and were behaving erratically: it's all good now

🪳 Actions requiring additional questions were bugging; these questions weren't opening: it's working again!

### 🤯 And lots of other things that seem trivial but are great

In terms of site functionality, you can now delete participants from a group of friends (if you're the administrator).

Display,

- thousands are displayed more clearly, with a nice thousands separator in space
- toast" messages 🍞 much cuter than before, with a little 🌈
- on iOS you're finally shown the numeric keypad and not the keyboard during the calculator..

On the technical side, we've done

- performance improvements for faster data loading
- a new shortcut for fast question answering
- improvements to the tracking of the emails we send you

On the administrative side, &lt;a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/stats">we've overhauled the statistics page&lt;/a>
