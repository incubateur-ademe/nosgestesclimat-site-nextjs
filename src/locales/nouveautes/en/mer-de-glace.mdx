## Nos Gestes Climat, v1

> In a nutshell: 
&gt 
> The action screen has been completely redesigned, with two paths and more gestures
> - the application has been partly redesigned: it's more modern and pleasant to use, especially on mobiles
> - we've introduced *personas*, so you can work more effectively on your next actions
> - share your simulation results on networks, and people will see a capture of your results straight away!

## Take action

We've completely redesigned the /actions screen.

We now have access to two modes, a guided one where actions are sorted by you, and a stand-alone one that lets you tackle the biggest reduction gestures.

The selection of gestures is now more complete, with 17 in all categories.

## Redesign of the application, especially on mobile

- we've adopted the conventions of the modern mobile, with finger-accessible navigation buttons at the bottom, and a session bar giving the simulation result also at the bottom and permanently visible

- on the action screen, the session bar remains predictable, in the same place but with the color of the category

- we've gained vertical space on mobile. Why is this important? To make phones &lt; 6 inches last. Not because 6 inches is bad, but because changing phones just for the screen is a shame. It won't revolutionize our footprint, but it's something!

## Simulation sharing

Big new feature that lets you preview simulation results when sharing on social networks. 
We hope to improve the application's distribution. Below, a Whatsapp capture.

 ## Introducing personas

This system, to be populated with profiles that are as representative of the population as possible, will enable us to better test and develop the application.

## Bug fixes

We've corrected a major bug: the simulation's "previous" button wasn't working properly. We've removed it, fixed the same problem that affected the "my answers" button, which now becomes the only way to modify your answers. It's now the only way to modify your answers.
