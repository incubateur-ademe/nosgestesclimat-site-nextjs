### 🍭 New colours everywhere for a more sparkling experience! 

Blue, orange, green, yellow and purple: the team wanted some bright colours for the new version of the site. And each carbon category now has its own colour! In keeping with our identity as a public project, and even one for the general public, we wanted to offer a calculator that was accessible and fun, right down to its graphic identity.
So here's how it looks in a few places... and it's not finished yet (spoiler: magnificent illustrations coming soon 😍)

<br/>

<img style="width: 600px;" alt="couleurs calculateur" src="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/assets/144152881/1524797a-8284-4828-9e49-3eda68332664" />
<br/>

### 🎯 A new, complete and educational end page

We recently redesigned our end page... although we liked its simplicity and sobriety, many of you told us that the lessons learned were not very clear.
So here's the new end page you can now use to view your carbon footprint results. What are the differences?
- More colours, more interaction, more animations: you learn better when you're having fun!
- A return to the target of 2 tonnes of CO2 / year / person (global target signed up to following COP21 in 2015)
- A stronger, more personalised link with our actions page: the best way to take action is to know your orders of magnitude and act accordingly
- New sharing features: the second best way to take action is to talk about it and share it!

What do you think? We'd love to hear from you, <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">via our contact page

<br/> 

### 👔 Ever more support for partner organisations and companies

It was already possible to add 2 "default" questions (town of residence and year of birth) to your Nos Gestes Climat for organisations campaign, but following numerous requests we have opened up the possibility of adding new questions. Please <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">contact us</a> with the e-mail address of the administrator account concerned, and we'll activate the option!

<img style="width:600px;" alt="orga questions compl" src="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/assets/144152881/8b28bb0a-09ff-4c8d-a782-d1518c63d224" />
<br/>

In an organisation, the advantage is that we are more aware of our impact on a larger scale: to make it easier for you to become more aware, we have added a graph with new data and details on the community of testers who belong to your organisation! Available in the "Detailed results" section
    
<img style="width: 600px;" alt="chiffres clefs" src="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/assets/144152881/dee79160-b1a8-4d18-9d71-0da7aa5522e1" />
<br/>

We've created URL parameters that allow you, when sharing Our Climate Gestures with your stakeholders, to customise the behaviour of the calculator: for example, to avoid people having to re-enter their email! All the details are on the dedicated page of our wiki: <a href="https://accelerateur-transition-ecologique-ademe.notion.site/Param-tres-d-URL-sp-cifiques-8becc3afbc2543d9a6f3febde9bb4b66">Specific URL parameters</a>
Finally, we've also reworked the organisation account creation function, in particular to prevent authentication emails (code) from going into your anti-spam mailboxes (MailInBlack in particular) and falling into the void! 

### 🌎 Our Climate Gestures, citizens of the world: more international!

For a few weeks now, you've been able to do your carbon simulation with a carbon model adapted to the United States, or to the European Union in general, if your country is not represented in our countries. These changes take into account country-specific emissions factors (such as the carbon content of the electricity mix), and offer the option of pre-filling certain content according to country or region.
Here is the list of calculation regions currently available: 

<br/>

<img style="width: 400px;" alt="regions" src="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/assets/144152881/0ef890fa-22d4-4eae-bb3c-460400ba3d3b" />
    
<br/>

Translations revised and added:

- an improved English translation
- and a new Spanish translation available in your footer

<img style="width: 400px;" alt="footer" src="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/assets/144152881/edcb98e8-34c2-4ce3-802a-ee462c8dd777" />       


### 🚗 Our newsletter cycle on the carbon impact of transport has been launched!

Our model team has worked to create ultra-qualitative content for you (thanks in particular to the resources of Aurélien Bigo, the best in the field) to help you understand the challenges of transport carbonation.
More than 3,000 people have already signed up to receive our series of 4 information emails on transport: what about you? 
Go to <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/profil">your profile page</a>, at the bottom of the page, enter your e-mail address and tick "Our Transport Gestures"
    
<img style="width: 400px;" alt="nos gestes transport" src="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/assets/144152881/ed22cd15-2d58-42bd-a66c-c608ca8668cf" />
    

### ✍️ New quality content to keep you better informed

- A new article on moving house, and what you need to consider to limit the carbon impact of your home and transport at this crucial time in your life

 <br/>

- Another one to give a reminder of the nicest means of transport with the climate... and the others. It could be interesting before the summer holidays 😊

- Throughout our blog, you'll now find a fun, visual equivalent to each written quantity of CO2, developed by our cousins at impactco2 (another ADEME project)

### 🌾 Improvements to the carbon model

The calculation of the emissions factors associated with the car has been revised in many places following lengthy discussions with our carbon experts:

- addition of the concept of the car owner
- revised calculation for electric cars, depending on battery type

We have also improved the calculations of the impact of fuel to bring them into line with the latest data available, and we have also renamed certain elements for greater clarity: in particular fish, which were not very clear according to a lot of the feedback we have received

Finally, with the help of ADEME, we've also rewritten the actions and updated the resources in the End <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/actions">Actions</a>.

### 🤖 And as always... various technical improvements

- A new site usage monitoring plan to improve functionality and avoid errors
- Technical improvements to speed up coding
