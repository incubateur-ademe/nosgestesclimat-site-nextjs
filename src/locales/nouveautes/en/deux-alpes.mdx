## New breakfasts & hot drinks 🥐☕️

The breakfast question has been improved with new proposals. A question on hot drinks has also been added!

## New waste calculation model 🚮

The trash footprint is evolving! A more accurate model updates the waste footprint with a more recent source. All discussions are in <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1110">this thread</a>. A mosaic of eco-gestures has also been added.

## Suggested answers in the form of buttons ✨

Suggestions are now more visible. Some mosaics also feature suggestions, which didn't exist before, like the meal selection!

## Optimization of ↘️ site weight

The weight of javascript loaded has been reduced from 1.4mo to 1.1, i.e. -20%. The site "s performance has been improved as part of an eco-design approach. The only visible difference is the font. All the progress made in this area can be found in <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/478">this discussion</a>.
