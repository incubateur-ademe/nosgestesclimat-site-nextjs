💧 The Amundsen Glacier, 128 km long, is one of the largest in Antarctica. To protect this endangered giant, innovative projects such as the installation of underwater curtains to slow down the melting are being studied to mitigate the impact of this melting on rising sea levels.

**In brief, at the end of the year:**

**✨** Semantic overhaul: the word "simulator" has officially retired, replaced everywhere by "calculator". Because precision in words counts!
**🎨** A site that's looking even better: new footer, new blog homepage, article pages...
🔧 The engine under the bonnet is running smoothly: version upgrades, tidying up the code...

### ✨ What's new

In detail, we've given the design a facelift, particularly on :

- A new, more engaging and clearer home page

![new home page](https://nosgestesclimat-prod.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/cms/landing_page_27acb9a1e7.png)

- Two new landing pages dedicated to our carbon and water footprints
- And we've got a new tool for writing blog posts: Strapi

Under the bonnet, we've also made a few optimisations:

- Improvement of the carbon model with the Ecobalyse version for water and textiles
- Corrections to holiday accommodation
- Trackers have been added on new pages to better understand how you navigate the site, always anonymised to protect your personal data.

### Technical improvements and internal updates

- New carbon model ("3.5.0" then "3.5.1")
- Deployment of assets on Scaleway
- Code clean-up: removal of dead bits of code with "ts-prune
- Removal of lazy loading for certain iframes after testing
- A new server-side "report" view to make better use of user results

### 🐛 Bug fixes

And last but not least, a few patches of course!

- Integration of the Vigieau API
- Language-dependent iframe reload bug
- Customised supplementary questions recovered correctly
- Saved modal problem fixed
