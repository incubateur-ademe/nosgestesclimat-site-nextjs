## A tutorial before testing üßë‚Äçüè´

We've added a tutorial for those unfamiliar with the concept of climate footprint and personal consumption climate footprint. This is in line with our strategy of opening up to audiences not yet aware of these subjects.

<a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1488059482647236608">The Ministry of the Environment provides a demo here</a>. 

## Local, seasonal food üåª üöõ

Based on Agribalyse, we have developed climate footprint variation models corresponding to seasonal and local diets.

To the best of our knowledge, these improvements are unprecedented! As you can see, these "options" have little influence if your diet is not already strongly vegetarian. 

## New screen to help you enter kilometers by car ‚å®Ô∏è üõ£Ô∏è

You may have noticed that the question "How many kilometers do you drive each year?" is difficult to answer in one go. 

So have we, and we've designed a form to help you do just that.

A big bonus: this form also eliminates the need to estimate a vehicle's fill rate, a task which is usually very risky. 

## Improvements to the "action" section üéØ

- two new actions to switch to seasonal and local foods
- we've improved the housing temperature reduction action: we now ask you for your current temperature
- a new action to become vegan
- we've separated the actions into different ranges, from "more than a ton" to "less than 10kg", and finally to "unquantified actions". 

## Gas price üî•

You've probably seen it before: gas prices are skyrocketing in France. Between +40% and +110% in just a few months. So we've revised upwards our tool for estimating kWh from ‚Ç¨/month. 

To do this, we've reimplemented the regulated rate gas bill, including the various taxes and subscriptions that affect this figure.

## New profile page

A small button appears on the home page, indicating that you already have data on nosgestesclimat.fr. As before, we don't store any data on our servers; everything is stored locally on your browser.

Above all, the profile page has been revamped, and it's now much easier to navigate through your answers.

## Ecodesign üèãÔ∏è

*Let's keep in mind that the footprint of a website's service and use in France is very small, and generally already naturally optimized by developers. The environmental impact of digital technology is essentially linked to manufacturing <a href="https://librairie.ademe.fr/cadic/5311/infographie-preferer-smartphone-reconditionne.pdf?modal=false">(70% for a smartphone, for example)</a>

### Small screens 

We're continuing our work to support small screens. 

Here are the improvements on iPhone5 SE.

In particular, we've optimized the footprint distribution graph, integrating text into the bars. It has also been animated, which makes it much easier to understand the impact of choices made during input.

### Site hosting

~~We've <a href="https://answers.netlify.com/t/low-carbon-european-cdn/48784">asked</a> our hosting provider (Netlify) if it would be possible for them to implement a server in France so that our users can see their site served from France, rather than from Germany at present.~~ (deprecated)

## Coming in 2022

See our roadmap for the calculation model <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/projects/1">here</a>.
