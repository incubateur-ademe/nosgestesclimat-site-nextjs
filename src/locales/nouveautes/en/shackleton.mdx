💧 The Shackleton Glacier, stretching almost 96 km across the Queen Maud Range to the Ross Gap in Antarctica, is named after the explorer Ernest Shackleton. Although it receives less media coverage than other glaciers, it embodies the history of the great polar expeditions. Recently, the wreck of the Endurance, Shackleton's ship, was found in remarkable condition!
