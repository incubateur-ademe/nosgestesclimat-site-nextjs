We've completely overhauled our selection of digital equipment. We did it <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/905">here</a>.

This is an important step towards taking better account of the digital footprint, previously limited by the resulting inflation of questions.

Not much else in this version, but the next one will be substantial 😉
