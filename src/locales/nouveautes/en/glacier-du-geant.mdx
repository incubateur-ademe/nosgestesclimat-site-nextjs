## English version 🇬🇧

Hi everyone! Nos Gestes Climat is now available in English 💂

Of course, translation is a long-term task, so if you find a problem, we have a page dedicated to feedback :

Soon it will also be possible to calculate your climate footprint in Spanish, Italian and other languages. 

> Please note, translation does not mean internationalization of the model: for the moment, there are only two calculation models, for metropolitan France and Guadeloupe. The others are coming soon!

## Brand-new figures for the food footprint

We've improved the footprints for lunch and dinner dishes. 

Firstly, we've improved the calculation of the emission factor for the most important component of meals, meat and fish. Rather than a simple average, we now calculate an average weighted by national consumption (for example, for the "meat 1" dish, pork and chicken are no longer equally important). 

Secondly, in October there was a global update of agribalyse, which corrected some overestimated emission factors. We have updated our figures accordingly.

## Improved navigation during and after the test

It's <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/677">now easier</a> to navigate through categories and answers already given after the test.

In the same vein, a new button `Find my simulation` has been added to the home page, and the progress of the test in % on the profile page. For further <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/672">information</a>.

## A new page to explain our fossil fuel dependency

A <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/pétrole-et-gaz">new page</a> to explain what's at stake in reducing our consumption of oil and gas. After all, climate is just one of them, and we're going through a period where inflation and geopolitical tensions are more and more part of the equation.
