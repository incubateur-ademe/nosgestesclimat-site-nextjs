💧 The **Totten Glacier** is a behemoth of the south, one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, capable on its own of impacting sea levels if it were to melt too quickly - a true barometer of climate change 🌡️.

**In a nutshell, at the start of the year**, we have

💧 Water is better highlighted
🐛 We're taking advantage of the winter to make a few repairs: broken redirections, dead links, hydration... we're chasing away every last grain of sand.
🔧 We're lightening the server: MongoDB is finished, we're preparing a migration to Postgre and Scalingo

### 💧 Display & UI

- Greater emphasis on the water footprint throughout the test: we announced its release here https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveautes/thwaites, the water footprint is now available in the test, but we still had to give it its rightful place in the path and the results page *Screenshot*

![better integration of the water footprint](https://nosgestesclimat-prod.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/cms/water_footprint_d288432ed8.png)

- Improved display and tracking iframes
- Customised questions activated by default
- Removal of electricity consumption from 'fun facts

### 🐛 Bye bye bugs

- Dead links fixed on end of test and news pages
- Bad redirection on organisation login page fixed
- Organisation admins are no longer admins on all campaigns
- and a few other fixes related to emails sent in the organisations folder

### Technical stabilisation and new conversion tool

- Switch to the 3.5.4 model on the calculator side
- MongoDB removed in favour of Postgre
- Start of a technical POC with 2 Tons to help them convert the results of your footprint on Nos Gestes Climat to their model.
- Integration of recent ADEME PDFs into certain info messages within the calculator, on composting (https://librairie.ademe.fr/7245-quel-equipement-pour-faire-son-compost-.html#/44-type_de_produit-format_electronique), fast fashion (https://librairie.ademe.fr/consommer-autrement/7747-tout-comprendre-les-impacts-de-la-mode-et-de-la-fast-fashion-9791029724602.html) and digital sobriety (https://librairie.ademe.fr/consommer-autrement/7575-comment-adopter-la-sobriete-numerique--9791029724237.html)
