## üé® A new logo, a new home page, and new icons

You won't have missed it, Nos Gestes Climat has a new logo ü•≥.

Frequently mentioned in the press, it will go even less unnoticed.

The home page follows this graphic evolution, with a few paragraphs to introduce the subject (and its limits).



### Before

### After

In the same way, we've worked on <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/570">the style and legibility of the</a> business <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/570">icons</a> throughout the site.

## üêé Performance (eco-design)

We have completed phase 2 of our sobriety work, in terms of site weight, with a <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/602">significant gain</a>. It's all relative, but a little sobriety on our side is the least we can do!

## üëÜÔ∏è Other interface improvements

- The <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe">survey mode</a> is no longer in beta, but has already been used by hundreds of organisations
- a notification appears when your home is depreciated (= built a long time ago): in this case, we don't ask you for its surface area (because we don't need it for the calculation), which surprised some users
- number entries in the questionnaire are now more restricted (you can no longer enter zero passengers in the car, for example), to reduce errors that could be caused by unexpected values (infinite or zero values)
- the "I don't know" button appears in mosaics (https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/604)
- the accessibility certificate (https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/621) is online, testifying to our work on this important aspect of websites

Overall, a great deal of work has gone into sorting and closing hundreds of feedback tickets, both <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/issues">on the model side</a> and <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues">on the site side</a>, with the contribution of as many people as possible always our priority.

## üßÆ Calculation model side

- <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1489">aircraft emission factors</a>updated
- the "consumption" part of the tea <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1494">is already included in your electricity bill</a>, this was a bug identified thanks to our parallel work on <a href="https://monconvertisseurco2.fr/empreinte-carbone/boisson">monconvertisseurco2.fr</a>
- the emission factor of the French electricity mix for 2021 <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1484">has been updated</a>

## üåÖ Coming soon...

We're currently working on regionalizing (overseas) and internationalizing the site üòé. See you soon!
