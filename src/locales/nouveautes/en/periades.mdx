> In summary: 
> - new questions and models for taking into account the age and construction materials of the home
> - a host of new climate-friendly gestures
> - a conference mode in preparation, already available for testing
> - bugs solved

## Housing age

Previously, a home built in 1901 had the same annual construction footprint as one built in 2019. Ouch. Fixed now. 

 -  age of home -> whether or not a footprint is taken into account, homes > 50 years old go to zero
 -  house vs. apartment
 -  traditional construction (concrete I think) vs. eco-built

## Lots of new ways to take action :boxing_glove: 

Which brings us to a good twenty!

But also : 
- switch to LEDs at home
- do without the car for journeys &lt; 5km
- give up the tumble dryer
- replace my gas boiler with oil

After a final salvo, we'll move on to improving the UX of this "climate gestures" section.


## Conference mode in the works

On PR number <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/222">222</a>, you can follow the progress of a brand-new simulation mode for ourclimategestures: make the simulation with several people! 

It will be useful for conferences and workshops, as well as for testing with friends.

## Bonus: computer hardware obsolescence

We're committed to fighting the digital footprint by not neglecting devices with lower definition than the current standard. Here's a little improvement in that direction: https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/issues/995
