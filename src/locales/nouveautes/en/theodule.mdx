#Theodule Glacier

What's new in November 2023

![Glacier du Théodule](https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/assets/144152881/b9d6ccef-2a61-403e-a424-798d80c89843)

> 🧊 The Théodule glacier, located on the border between Switzerland and Italy, is at the heart of a scandal in the confederation: in anticipation of the Ski World Cup in the Swiss town of Zermatt, one of the new slopes created partially encroaches on an area outside the ski area, and therefore on part of the Théodule glacier, which would therefore have been damaged (with a shovel).

**The latest changes in brief :**

- ⚡ A faster, more flexible site
- 🏁 A new test completion page
- 🗣️ Pages dedicated to our partners
- 🇨🇭 Nos Gestes Climat arrives in Switzerland! 
- 🪡 An increasingly accurate calculation model
- 🤖 Some technical improvements




## ⚡ A faster, more flexible site

It's a small step for you, but a big step for the team: the Nos Gestes Climat website has been rewritten using a new <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_Web">framework*</a> <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next</a>), which will allow us to:

- limit loading time for you (you're happy!)
- develop it much more easily (the developers are happy too!)



## 🏁 A new end page for the test

We are now proposing a new, simplified end page, in order to :

- *value the overall result*, without displaying the 2T target corresponding to the Paris agreements, which gave most of you the impression that it was unachievable. This objective remains, but we would like to present it in a different light, to re-explain the importance of implementing these changes from a societal and global point of view in order to achieve this objective.

new end page](https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site-nextjs/assets/144152881/9339dfe1-41b7-4c4e-ae18-5ee644c7908a)



- be able to go into the sub-categories of each main emission item, with the aim of providing you with *the best possible orders of magnitude*: what weighs most heavily on my transport today? etc.

sub-categories in the end page](https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site-nextjs/assets/144152881/405402e7-f5b5-4040-8c66-6e730781a1ba)



- support you for the rest*: you can still receive your results by email, but we also want to invite you to create a group to compare your results with your friends, convinced that it's through the group that we'll get everyone on board for this historic cause.

- always *give you ideas for impactful actions* to put in place to reduce your footprint as effectively as possible.

This page will continue to evolve, so don't hesitate to give us your opinion on <a href="https://www.notion.so/Th-odule-891ecde9619d445d9c7462751dfde7c1?pvs=21">our contact page</a>. Your feedback is invaluable in helping NGC to evolve even further!




## 🗣️ Pages dedicated to our partners


### 📢 Update of the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/diffuser">Distribute</a>page

This page provides all the information you need to use Nos Gestes Climat as a company, school or organisation: 

- integrate Nos Gestes Climat into your own website
- mobilise a group or organisation and compare the results
- run conferences or workshops
- talk about Nos Gestes Climat in the media




### 👯 Create an <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/ambassadeurs">ambassador gallery</a>page

As Nos Gestes Climat is already a reference simulator for many media and personalities, we wanted to make the list of these reusers accessible.

## 🇨🇭 Nos Gestes Climat arrives in Switzerland!

Since 13 November, thanks to an exclusive partnership with the canton of Geneva and <a href="https://2050today.org/">2050 today</a>, the people of Geneva have been able to calculate their carbon footprint on a dedicated website featuring the Nos Gestes Climat simulator. 

This required a great deal of work on the part of the team to : 

- meet the technical requirements for integrating the simulator into an iframe
- support the creation and review of the Geneva carbon model, in order to adapt it from the French model




<a href="https://geneve.nosgestesclimat.ch/">The site can be accessed via this link.</a>

## 🪡 An increasingly accurate calculation model

Our team in charge of the carbon model, Clément and Julie, are constantly working on the accuracy and updating of the carbon calculation data, thanks in particular to in-depth research work, and feedback from our partner <a href="https://abc-transitionbascarbone.fr/">ABC</a>.

In recent weeks, they have been working on : 

- updating all the 'default' values: if I click on 'I don't know', which value is taken into account, and what does it represent?
- standardising the units used in the model
- accuracy of data concerning the car: air conditioning, maintenance and repair of the car, use of a single car or several cars, etc
- fixing a bug in the calculation of biogas consumption with the invoice
- various optimisations to ensure the model works properly





## 🤖 Technical

- Review of the translation model (from en-us to en)
- Review of markdown content management
- Correction of a few typos and minor bugs




💡 As a reminder, all development of the Nos Gestes Climat public service is done transparently on the Github platform, on the <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/">site side</a> and <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat">on the calculation model side</a>.

See you soon for more news!
