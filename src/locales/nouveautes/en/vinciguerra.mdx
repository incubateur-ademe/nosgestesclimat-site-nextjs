💧 Located near Ushuaïa, the Vinciguerra glacier is one of Tierra del Fuego's natural treasures. It offers breathtaking scenery, including the Los Témpanos lagoon, dotted with icebergs. Classified as a Ramsar site in 2009, this glacier is an indicator of the effects of climate change, having lost around 50% of its surface area between 1970 and 2008.
