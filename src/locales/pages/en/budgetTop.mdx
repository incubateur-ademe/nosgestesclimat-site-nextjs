# Budget

**Nos Gestes Climat** is a digital public service, which is why we are
transparent about the resources allocated and how they are used.

## Principles

We follow the [beta.gouv manifesto](https://beta.gouv.fr/approche/manifeste)
and recall its principles here:

> - **Users' needs come before those of the administration**, in order to focus public resources where they create the most impact;
> - **The team operates on trust and autonomy**, to decide quickly and effectively on budget usage;
> - **We progress through iterations and continuous improvement**, systematically measuring the real impact of our actions.

## How it works

Nos Gestes Climat is a "state start-up": the team is therefore led by an intrapreneur who is responsible for the digital service developed within their administration (ADEME in this case).

Their role is multiple: defining strategy and roadmap, leading teams, product management, service deployment, and acting as a liaison with their administration (budget, progress reports).

The budget shown here does not include the intrapreneur, who is an employee of DINUM (Interministerial Directorate for Digital) and seconded to ADEME, but concerns the team members.
