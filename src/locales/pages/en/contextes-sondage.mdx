# Contextualising a survey

## What for?

Contextualising a survey makes it possible to store additional information
additional information to the classic simulation: each respondent is asked a few
questions before accessing their test.

In this way, an organisation can send out a single survey link and collect information that
information that differentiates users (questions that are not related to the
nos Gestes Climat test: for example, their age, profession, etc. or a sub-group)
a sub-group).

For the moment, the context elements are available in the downloaded CSV
(no filtering possible on the display screen).

## How do I add this functionality to my survey?

Survey "contexts" are published on the Nos Gestes Climat server, in the
the folder
<a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-server/tree/master/contextes-sondage">/contexts-survey</a> folder.

The questions are written in the <a href="https://publi.codes/">publicodes</a>
in 'yaml' format.

**We have chosen to keep control of the published survey contexts, so the Nosgestesclimat team plays the role of administrator and helps you create your context and publish it for your survey**

A
<a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-server/tree/master/contextes-sondage/template%20de%20contexte.yaml">template</a>
allows you to write your own context form. You can also
use the <a href="https://vu.fr/szYP">publicodes sandbox</a>. Don't hesitate to
contact us with a first draft to contextualise your survey!
Please note that **the name of the file created must be different from the name envisaged for the survey** (see next point).

## And from a technical point of view?

The survey rules are loaded from the server when
the user accesses a survey with a context. To avoid
make all the poll URLs with context public, the name of the context file
context file is different from the survey name. The file name is assigned via
database administration directly. Only surveys with
have a context attached offer additional questions, nothing changes for other
changes for other surveys.
