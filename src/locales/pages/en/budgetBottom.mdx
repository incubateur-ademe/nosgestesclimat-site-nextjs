### Description of cost categories

Development, product, deployment and design costs are exclusively "person-time" for the team. 10 people work for Nos Gestes Climat as freelancers and part-time (between 50 and 80% of their time), which represents 5.6 FTE over the year. Communication costs correspond to visibility operations or media partnerships.

Our open-source model allows us to access most of the tools we use for free (code hosting, test servers, etc.). The site is hosted on [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com/).

> activity.

> The amount including VAT includes VAT at the rate of 20%.
>
> VAT is collected and paid to the State and therefore reduces the amount of budget
> usable for the project.
