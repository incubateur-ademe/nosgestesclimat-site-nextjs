## The reference calculator

With **more than a<a href="/stats">million tests completed**</a>, nosgestesclimat.fr is the benchmark personal carbon footprint calculator.

## What is a climate footprint?

It's a fact that the climate is warming because of human activity. But what impact are we, as individual citizens, having?

To estimate our own contribution to global warming (our "climate impact"), we usually calculate _our individual carbon footprint_.

The principle is simple: for each item of consumption (taking the car for 10km, eating a steak, heating the house with gas, etc.), we count the greenhouse gas emissions (the various gases that warm the earth's climate) over its life cycle. For example, a purchased good is manufactured, then used, then thrown away and perhaps recycled.

As you answer the questions on all aspects of our lifestyles, broken down into major areas such as food, housing and transport, the weight of each of your consumption items is added to make up your total, your personal carbon footprint, which can be viewed on three computer graphics.

## Reduce your carbon footprint now!

Knowing your footprint is great, but knowing how to reduce it is even better. After a 10-minute test, the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/actions">action trail</a> allows you to prioritise the eco-gestures you can take to reduce your footprint, distinguishing between small gestures to help the climate (replacing light bulbs, switching off appliances on standby) and major gestures (eating less meat, electrifying our appliances, etc.) that have a significant impact.

Of course, even if it's essential to measure the footprint of our consumption and understand its scale in relation to the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog/environnement/budget">climate budget</a>, it's often the case that it's not entirely within our own control: for example, I'm a tenant in a high pressure area and my landlord refuses to insulate my flat.

You will also notice that reaching the target of 2 tonnes of CO₂ₑ per person as quickly as possible is a daunting task. But don't forget you won't be alone on your journey towards a low-carbon lifestyle: this is a collective transformation that involves the State, local authorities, businesses, and society as a whole.
