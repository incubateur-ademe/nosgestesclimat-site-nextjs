# Spreading our Climate Action

Nos Gestes Climat is a public service, its code <a href="/documentation">is free</a> and can be reused by anyone. 

We also urge you to share our carbon footprint calculator with others, in a variety of ways - and without requiring development skills!

Find out more about our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ppvieBBNCSSkvREGIAAK44PmPNy9CRz9">ambassador distribution kit</a> and all the options available to you below.

Don't hesitate to let us know <a href="/contact">on our contact page</a> so that we can add you to our <a href="/ambassadeurs">ambassador gallery</a>.

## 🖥️ **Do you want to integrate the calculator directly into your website?

Nothing could be simpler! Integrate it as an iframe in a blog post or website simply by adding the line below to your web page.

<script id="nosgestesclimat" src="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/iframe.js"></script>

## ✊ **Would you like to get the people around you, in your local authority, company or university, involved?

Nos Gestes Climat has been designed to be a tool for mobilisation, and we are delighted to be able to count on you to help us amplify this dynamic through dedicated campaigns.

Our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ppvieBBNCSSkvREGIAAK44PmPNy9CRz9">distribution kit</a> can be used to customise your campaign to encourage your friends and family to carry out their carbon footprint.

To make your campaign more fun, use the "organisations" function, which gives you the average carbon footprint of all respondents, overall and by emissions category (more information in our <a href="/blog/actualites-et-fonctionnalites/nouveau-parcours-organisations">dedicated article</a>).

👉 Create your space on <a href="/organisations">www.nosgestesclimat.fr/organisations</a>

🪂 Distribute the generated link and organise a turnkey awareness and action campaign using our distribution kit

🗓️ Follow the campaign's progress daily on your online dashboard

If you need any support or would like to co-construct your campaign, you can request a demonstration <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/organisations/demander-demo">on this page</a>.
