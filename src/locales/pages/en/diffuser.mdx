# Spreading Nos Gestes Climat

Nos Gestes Climat is a public service, its code is <a href="/documentation">free</a> and can be reused by anyone. 

We also urge you to share our carbon footprint simulator with others, in a variety of ways - and without requiring development skills!

## ✊ Would you like to get the people around you, in your local authority, company or university, involved?

Nos Gestes Climat has been designed to be a tool for mobilising people, and we're delighted to be able to count on you to help us build on this momentum through dedicated campaigns.

To make your campaign more fun, use the "organisations" function, which gives you the average carbon footprint of all respondents, overall and by emissions category (more information in our <a href="/blog/nouveau-parcours-organisations">dedicated article</a>).
