# Repo guidelines

## Types

- **Derive, don't hardcode.** Types must emerge from a single source of truth. No copy-pasted overloads. No `Record<X, Y>` when a mapped type will do.
- **No `as unknown`.** Use native discriminants, narrow casts, or type guards. Lazy typing is rejected.
- **No unnecessary indirection.** `Maybe<T>` → just write `T | undefined`. `CONST['key']` when a bare string literal works → no.
- **`satisfies` on every structured config.** Catches omissions at build time.

## Tests

- **Mock dependencies, don't pollute production.**
- **No over-engineering.** Cover real bug paths. Framework-testing mocks are noise.

## Code

- **No comments unless asked.** Light JSDoc on exported functions is fine.
- **Follow existing patterns.** Don't invent new conventions when the repo already has one.
- **DRY, not clever.** Deduplicating identical blocks → yes. A type alias saving 10 chars → no.
- **Validate at runtime unknown values.**


## Communication

- **When the user says "this is wrong", don't ignore it.** Either comply or state your case _before_ writing code.
- **Push only when asked.**
- **Always verify lint + typecheck + tests before proposing a commit.**
- First, complete the implementation to the best of your understanding. Then, **perform an architectural self-review**: read every file you created or touched, compare it against the surrounding codebase for naming consistency, layer violations, and missing conventions (factory, mapper, barrel). Fix any drift before you declare completion.
- **Code in English, communicate in French.**
